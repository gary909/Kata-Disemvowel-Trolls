    <title>Kata: Disemvowel Trolls</title>

    <p>
        Trolls are attacking your comment section!<br>
<br>
        A common way to deal with this situation is to remove all of the vowels from the trolls' <br>
        comments, neutralizing the threat.<br>
<br>
        Your task is to write a function that takes a string and return a new string with all <br>
        vowels removed.<br>
<br>
        For example, the string "This website is for losers LOL!" would become "Ths wbst s fr <br>
        lsrs LL!".<br>
<br>
        Note: for this kata y isn't considered a vowel.<br>
